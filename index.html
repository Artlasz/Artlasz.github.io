					<h1><strong>Hi! I'm Arttu.</strong> <br />
					<br />
					I'm a passionate game developer with experience in 3d modelling using Blender, game design in Unity and programming in C#. But I'm primarily focused on 3d modelling. <br />
					<br />
					I love working with others and I'm always eager to learn new things!</h1>

							<h2>Arttu Lasonen - Portfolio <br />
							</h2>
						</header>
						<p>I'm a 17 year old game developer, turning 18 in December - on my 3rd year at Sataedu in Finland. Before vocational school I studied in college for a year, but I found that I'd rather do more artistic and creative work.<br />
							<br />
							I'd describe myself as a quick learner with a strong will and love for detail. I see things through to the end despite challenges and hardship that may come along the way, as you only truly fail if you never get back up. I'm always challenging myself and learning new things - so I can hone my skills and make my dreams into reality! <br />
						<br />
					I enjoy making expressive and well designed models that fit the worlds they're meant for - as well as having clean topology and edge flow, allowing for easier animation and texturing. <br />
					More succintly, I like clean and efficient work!<br />
					<br />
				I was inspired to become a game developer due to my hobbies and interests. <br />
				I've always been a big fan of video games and played them my whole life, I see video games as a beautiful artform that utilises multiple different artforms together to create experiences no other medium can create. The stories and experiences you can make through games are unlike any other, they allow the player to change and affect the world they're interacting with - which is a massive boon! <br />
				<br /> 
				But that aside, I've always admired art and wanted to create it myself - so I picked up game development and eventually settled on 3d modelling. <br />
				I've also had excellent English language skills for most of my life - and this skill of mine has only gotten better with time. Through this, I've been in touch with video games and the internet at large for a long time. <br />

								<h3>Full Body Base Model</h3>
								<p>This was my first time with a project of this scale and it proved very challenging, but through weeks of hard work I managed to get the grip of modelling more detailed characters like this. <br />
							    <br />
								<br />
								This project followed the workflow of blockout, sculpt and retopology. <br /> 
								<br />
								Making the blockout is simple enough, as it comprises of using a reference to mold simple shapes into the general shape of whatever you want to model. <br />
								After this comes sculpting - which I was already familiar with due to previous projects, but I had never used it in tandem with retopology before. During the sculpting phase you turn the blockout from a general shape into the desired shape, refining it and adding a great deal of detail. Sculpting is usually a lengthy procedure, but it gives great control to the modedeller to make fine details. <br />
								Lastly came the retopology - which was a massive challenge! Retopology is done to reduce the amount of vertexes on the model to allow for animation, but without sacrificing much detail. This has to be done due to sculpts having an incredibly high amount of vertexes, which is incompatible with animation. It consists of drawing vertexes over the sculpt for hours on end until the entire model is drawn over - after which you can then rig and weightpaint the model to make it possible to animate. Retopology also allows you to easily edit the model without having to use sculpting tools, this is because you keep the detail but have far fewer vertexes - which translates to more control over the model. The issue was that I had never done retopology on such a scale before and it took a very long time to accomplish with good quality in mind, but the end result was fantastic, with good edge flow and topology. <br />
								It was a very difficult project, but very worth it with how much I learned from it. <br /> 
								<br />
								The biggest challenge to overcome was retopology and understanding good edge flow and topology - but due to the experience from this project, I managed to learn these concepts and put them into practice. <br />
								<br />
								<br />
								Project Info: <br />
								I made this model in 4 weeks by myself. <br />
								The tool used was Blender. <br />

								<h3>Hands</h3>
								<p>I modelled these hands for the Full Body Base Model seen earlier, hands have a bad reputation for being hard to make in art - but I found it to be enjoyable! <br />
								<br />
							    <br />
							    This project used a slightly altered workflow where we use a blockout, edit into the desired shape, use the subdivision modifier and then sculpt the shape and add the finer details. <br />
							    <br />
							    Modelling the hands proved to be to somewhat difficult, but I found it to be more entertaining than annoying. Using the subdivision modifier helped greatly, as it allows you to use a blockier shape - which the modifier smoothens to allow for clean sculpting. The hands were much faster to model than the body itself, due to being a smaller part of the bigger picture. <br />
							    <br />
							    The greatest challenge for this one was definitely the fingers, it took much sculpting and editing to make them look accurate. But the end result was very nice! <br />

								<h3>Feet</h3>
								<p>These were also modelled for the aforementioned Full Body Base Model. <br />
									<br />
									<br />
								    The workflow of modelling the feet was the same as the hands, we make a blockout using a reference, edit it into the general desired shape, use the subdivision modifier to smooth it out and then sculpt the final detail and polish. <br />
								    <br />
								    The difficulty of this one was about the same as the the hands, since they follow the same process but for a different model. <br />
								    <br />

								 <a href="images/fulls/Christmas Wreath Render.16.png" class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/thumbs/Christmas Wreath Render.16.png" alt="" /></a>
								 <h3>Christmas Wreath</h3>
								 <p>I modelled this Christmas Wreath during the winter season for an assignment I was given. <br />
									<br />
									<br />
								    For this one I used a lot of modifiers to speed up the process greatly - so instead of modelling each one of those dozens and dozens of branches, I modelled a few, positioned them as an outer ring and used modifiers to make them into a continuous circle and spread them out a little. The bells however only use the subdivision modifier, as well as having a nice metal shine. Lastly, there's all the lights on the wreath which I placed by hand where I thought they would look nice. <br />
								    <br />
								    Another interesting part of this project is the background! It's not just a wall or a singular colour, rather it is a rolling background reminiscent of the ones professional photographers use in real life - to spread the light out and give some nice depth to the image. You can see this in greater detail if you go to my Cara page through the full portfolio button. <br />
									<br />
									Getting all the shadows, lights and reflections to look good took a lot of effort - but the final render came out phenomenal. I came out of this project with a good understanding of renders in Blender. <br />
								    <br />

								    I made this model in 5 days by myself. <br />

								 <h3>Head Sculpt</h3>
								 <p>This sculpt was made as part of my regular studies. I wanted to get a grip of Blender's sculpting tools and thought a realistic head would be a great way to do this - and it came out quite alright. <br />
									<br />
									<br />
									This was my first time trying a realistic style, so I learned a lot in the process. There's some anatomical errors on the model that I noticed after making it - but I took these errors into account and adjusted appropriately for future projects. <br />
									<br />
									There's many small but important details on this model such as the subtle yellow, red and blue colouring found around the forehead, nose and lips area respectively. These contribute to making the model more believable, as it is based on a real phenomena that occurs due to how blood circulates. <br />
									<br />
									Overall, I came out of this project with a good grasp on how to sculpt in Blender and how to utilise the toolset.<br />

							<a href="images/fulls/Low Poly Man Render 2.png" class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/thumbs/Low Poly Man Render 2.png" alt="" /></a>
							<h3>Low Poly Man</h3>
							<p>I modelled this low poly character as part of my second year evaluated project. I wanted to do something simple, but also good looking - so I settled for a low poly character with cel shading. <br />
								Part of this project was also to UV map, rig and animate the model - which I managed to accomplish in the allotted time period.<br />
								<br />
							    <br />
							    I hadn't ever tried cel shading before so it was a new experience for me - but I managed to get a general understanding of its implementation relatively quickly. The model itself is detailed to follow the laws of anatomy with a hint of stylisation, so despite the low poly nature - it looks clean with the help of smooth shader. <br />
							    <br />
							    The cel shading was accomplished through the shader editor using shader nodes that use a solidify modifier to display the effect. <br />
								Then the animation was done using a standard humanoid rig I made from scratch, which I then animated by hand with the help of inverse kinematics. <br /> 
								Lastly the UV mapping was accomplished using a texture preview I made to display the UV map while adjusting it, as well unwrapping the map into distinc areas contained by seams. This way I was able to easily adjust each area to display their texture correcly and smoothly, <br />

						<h3>Low Poly Lisa</h3>
						<p>The idea behind this model was to make a low poly version of Lisa from Genshin Impact for my regular studies. General practice from modelling with a reference sheet. <br />
							<br />
						    <br />
						    This was my first time modelling minimal assistance, in other words - just me and a reference sheet. By this point I had a good grasp of how to use and navigate Blender so I managed to get good results despite the tight time period. <br />
							<br />
							I learned a lot from the errors I made in this model, such as the errors in topology which made animation difficult. Overall, it was a good learning experience that taught me to keep an eye on how I model. <br />

					<h3>Low Poly Phia</h3>
					<p>This was a character I created for a local Game Jam I participated in - which didn't quite succeed due to being too ambitious for the allotted amount of time, but still served as a great learning experience. This is also some of my earlier work, so my workflow was much slower. <br />
						<br />
					    <br />
					    This was modelled for a FPS game with cutscenes showing the player, which meant modelling a full character instead of just hands. The model itself is low poly, following a retro style and using UV mapping for the details. <br />
					    <br />
					    The model is fully rigged, which I utilised to create first person animations for using equipment. As for the cutscenes, time ran out before those could be made. <br />
						From this project - I learned to not be too ambitious and plan ahead for my projects. So while this specific project didn't succeed, it helped to build the foundation of future success. <br />
